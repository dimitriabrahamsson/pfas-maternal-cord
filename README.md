## Modeling the transplacental transfer of small molecules using machine learning models: A case study on PFAS
#### Previous studies that examined concentration differences of chemicals between maternal and umbilical cord blood samples suggest that the partitioning of chemicals between maternal and cord blood (Rcm) is determined by the chemicals' physicochemical properties.

#### In this study we examined the application of 3 different machine learning algorithms at predicting Rcm based on the chemicals' physicochemical properties.
